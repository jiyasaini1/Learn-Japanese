#Learn-Japanese
Learn Japanese with React is an engaging and interactive project that 
harness the power of react to facilitate the learning of Hiragana - a 
foundational component of the Japanese writing system. This Project 
welcomes you to explore the world of Hiragana with the help of React.
This Quiz is a Simple Web Application built using the React JavaScript 
Library. This project is designed to help users learn and practice the 
Japanese Hiragana Characters by providing a quiz format. Users are 
presented with the Hiragana character, and they need to type the 
corresponding Romanji (the Romanized version of the character). This 
Quiz keeps track of the userâ€™s streak, which is the number of 
consecutive correct answers, and the maximum streak achieved.
